# Development Activity Log

## Project: AI-Powered Workflow Automation Platform for SMBs

### Session 1 - Project Setup and Planning (August 1, 2025)

#### Initial Setup
- **User Request**: "I have a comprehensive app I want you to build based on the requirements.md, design-notes.md, and CLAUDE.md files... Create a robust readme.md file explaining the application, then create a plan to implement this application... After you are done planning, start coding !!"

#### Analysis Phase
- ✅ Read and analyzed requirements.md (AI-powered workflow automation platform for SMBs)
- ✅ Read and analyzed design-notes.md (React-Bootstrap UI design patterns)
- ✅ Read and analyzed CLAUDE.md (Development guidelines and process)
- ✅ Identified key features: Document processing, workflow builder, CRM integration, AI chatbot, analytics
- ✅ Understood compliance requirements: GDPR, HIPAA, enterprise security

#### Planning Phase
- ✅ Created comprehensive 44-task implementation plan
- ✅ Organized into 10 phases from Foundation to Deployment
- ✅ Technology stack selected: React + Vite, Django + DRF, PostgreSQL, Redis
- ✅ User approved the implementation plan

#### Foundation Tasks Started
- ✅ **Task 1**: Created comprehensive README.md with full project documentation
  - Documented all features, architecture, user roles, modules
  - Added setup instructions, project structure, deployment guidelines
  - Included performance targets, roadmap, and support information
- ✅ Created docs/activity.md for development tracking
- ✅ Set up todo tracking system with 5 initial tasks

#### Foundation Implementation Completed
- ✅ **Task 1**: Created comprehensive README.md with full project documentation
- ✅ **Task 2**: Initialized React application with Vite and React-Bootstrap
- ✅ **Task 3**: Set up Django backend with all required packages
- ✅ **Task 4**: Created proper project structure matching design-notes.md
- ✅ **Task 5**: Updated documentation and activity tracking

#### Technical Setup Completed
1. **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite + React-Bootstrap + React Router + Axios
2. **Backend**: Django 5.2 + DRF + JWT + Celery + Redis + PostgreSQL
3. **Project Structure**: Atomic design pattern for React components
4. **Django Apps**: users, documents, workflows, integrations, chatbot, analytics
5. **Environment**: .env.example files created for both frontend and backend

#### Current Status
- **Phase 1 Complete**: Project foundation and setup finished
- **Next Phase**: Authentication and user management system
- **Ready for**: Development of core features

#### Key Decisions Made
1. **Architecture**: React SPA frontend + Django API backend
2. **UI Framework**: React-Bootstrap for professional business appearance  
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL for production scalability
4. **Authentication**: JWT with MFA for security compliance
5. **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for NLP and document processing
6. **Development Approach**: Phase-based implementation starting with MVP

#### Notes
- Following CLAUDE.md guidelines for simplicity and incremental development
- All components will include data-testid attributes for easy UI communication
- Git commits will be made after each successful implementation phase
- Documentation updated with each major milestone
- Ready to begin Phase 2: Core Authentication & User Management
